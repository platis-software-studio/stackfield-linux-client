## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash

   cd stackfield-desktop-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

## Building for Distribution

To create a distributable version:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create platform-specific packages in the `dist/` folder.

## How it Works

The app loads Stackfield in an Electron window and monitors for:
- Personal message notifications (red badges)
- Page title changes indicating new messages
- Updates the system tray icon to alert you of unread messages

## Configuration

The app automatically:
- Prevents multiple instances
- Hides to system tray when closed
- Opens external links in your default browser
- Flashes the window when new notifications arrive

## Icons

Make sure you have these icon files in your project directory:
- `icon.png` - Normal state icon
- `icon-alert.png` - Alert state icon (when you have notifications)

Please note: Icons are generated with AI. Not sure, if there are copyright issues. If in doubt, Use your own icons.
