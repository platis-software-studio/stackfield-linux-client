## Building for Distribution

To create a distributable version:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create platform-specific packages in the `dist/` folder.

## Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js                    # Main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screenSharingManager.js    # Screen sharing logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screenPicker.js           # Screen picker dialog
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screenPickerWindow.html   # Screen picker UI (dark theme)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notificationManager.js    # Notification monitoring
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ menuManager.js           # Application menus
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debugManager.js          # Debug system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png                 # Normal state icon
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icon-alert.png          # Alert state icon
```

## Configuration

The app automatically handles:
- **Single Instance Prevention**: Only one app instance can run
- **External Link Handling**: Non-Stackfield URLs open in default browser
- **Permission Management**: Handles camera, microphone, and screen sharing permissions
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Platform-Specific Features

#### macOS
- Automatic permission requests for camera, microphone, and screen recording
- Native menu bar integration
- System Preferences integration for permissions

#### Windows/Linux
- System tray context menus
- Native window controls
- Automatic permission handling

## Icons

Make sure you have these icon files in your project directory:
- `icon.png` - Normal state icon (16x16px recommended for tray)
- `icon-alert.png` - Alert state icon (16x16px recommended for tray)

**Note**: Icons are AI-generated. For commercial use, please replace with your own icons to avoid potential copyright issues.

## Troubleshooting

### Screen Sharing Issues
- **macOS**: Grant screen recording permission in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Screen Recording
- **Permission Errors**: Restart the application after granting system permissions
- **No Sources Available**: Check that other applications aren't blocking screen capture

### Debug Mode
- Enable Debug Mode from the menu to see detailed error messages
- Check the console for permission-related issues
- Use `window.testScreenShare()` in DevTools to test screen sharing directly

## Development

### Project Structure
The codebase follows a modular pattern:
- Each feature is separated into its own manager class
- Debug code is isolated and can be toggled on/off
- Clean separation between main process and renderer process logic

### Adding Features
1. Create a new manager class for your feature
2. Initialize it in `main.js`
3. Add any UI components as separate files
4. Update the menu system if needed
